ATVClient - AppleTV Remote XBMC Eventclient
-------------------------------------------

A XMBC event client for the AppleTV, emulating the behaviour as experienced
under the AppleTV OS.


UPDATE
------

Added user configurable support for NEC protocol remotes.

Run atvclient in debug mode and validate that it sees codes from your NEC
remote.  If your is compatible, output will look like below.

26 f6 00 bc 43 
Event id: 0000
Event id: 0000

26 f6 00 be 41 
Event id: 0000
Event id: 0000

Ignore the first byte and record the remaining four as your remote code.
Create a text configuration file that maps the four byte remote code to
the remote key names recognized by Xbmc.

Example configuration files and the xbmc remote key list are found in the
examples directory.
